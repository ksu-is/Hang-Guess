# Hunter - I have started exploring multiple repositories to see how I can use different aspects and how i could use them for my own project. The main repository I have forcused on is one called hangman in python. I have learned how I could make different levels of difficulty, how to use ASCII to make the game look better, and different ways to make the game more fun.

# A- I Looked at a fun little game that taught me that there are endless possibilities when it comes to coding, even with the code we have only learned this semester it seems very possible to create something complex such as the game i looked at. The code was all similar to what we have learned and really opened up my eyes to how far one can go with coding.

We have been working on getting all the selection methods and the startup for the game running and working. 1st

Started working and making the letter guessing programs with the lose and win messages. 2nd

We both decided that the code we were using was not doing the processes we wanted so we changed it up and now are back on track. 3rd


We add 3 text documents for each different difficulty. 4th

We have the code up and running just need to add so finishing touchs to make it cleaner. 5th
